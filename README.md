# ABOUT ME

<p>
I am a mathematician and scientist, a technologist and a futurist, and a contemporary thinker in mathematics, science and computing education. My passion is exploring the world, searching for its mysteries, and discovering its hidden patterns. This passion has driven me to study mathematics, physics and computer science and to use the concepts and techniques that I have learnt to solve problems. I look to a future of significant advancement in technological innovation underpinned by new mathematics, breakthrough physics, and novel computing capabilities.

# MY ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

<p>
My academic background is extensively mathematical with focus in areas of pure mathematics, computer science and theoretical physics. I have completed coursework in measure theory, topological spaces, functional analysis, stochastic processes, time series analysis, and numerical partial differential equations. I have also done research in complex differential equations, special functions in mathematics physics and black-hole geometries in curved spacetimes.

<p>
I am currently completing a masters degree in Computer Science focusing on advanced analytics and technologies for big data and artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms and cloud computing applications. I have carried out advanced analytics on a big messy dataset, and designed and evaluated classification algorithms on it for predictive analysis. I am currently working on developing deep learning models for image analysis and classification. My interest is in developing deep learning models, neural networks and computer vision applications for smart and sustainable communities development.
</p>
<p>
I am also a teacher at-heart, but not in the traditional sense; I believe that 21st century educational systems structure, learning paradigms and assessment methods should reflect the technologically advanced era in which we live, and should reflect the nature and characteristics of the local and internation community. This philosophy has led me to complete a masters of arts degree in education where I focused my efforts on understanding the impact of computational thinking on student achievement and motivation, and how to use systems thinking, analysis and design to leverage the full benefits of educational technology in strategic educational development.
