# MY ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND

<p>
My academic background is extensively mathematical with focus in areas of pure mathematics, computer science and theoretical physics. I have completed coursework in measure theory, topological spaces, functional analysis, stochastic processes, time series analysis, and numerical partial differential equations. I have also done research in complex differential equations, special functions in mathematics physics and black-hole geometries in curved spacetimes.
</p>
<p>
I am currently completing a masters degree in Computer Science focusing on advanced analytics and technologies for big data and artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms and cloud computing applications. My interest is in developing deep learning models, neural networks and computer vision applications for smart and sustainable communities development.
</p>
<p>
I am also a teacher at-heart, but not in the traditional sense; I believe that 21st century educational systems structure, learning paradigms and assessment methods should reflect the technologically advanced era in which we live, and should reflect the nature and characteristics of the local and internation community.
