# ABOUT ME

<p>
I am a Biomedical Engineering researcher at the University of Reading, specialising in functional analysis, scientific machine learning, and brain network dynamics. My work advances the modelling of neural criticality in brain networks and biomarker analysis using fractional function spaces (Sobolev-Slobodeckij and Besov spaces), as well as multiscale physics- and biophysics-informed fractional neural operator learning. I am interested in developing a generalised mathematical framework for describing open, dissipative, and nonequilibrium dynamical systems with long memory and multifractal properties, such as neural criticality observed in brain networks, and in using differentiable and probabilistic programming to develop innovative neural architectures for ground-truth generation and simulation of such phenomena.

As a STEM educator with 16 years of experience, I excel in educational leadership, machine learning applications, and technology-driven curricula across the US, UK, and Caribbean systems. I promote the development of analytical skills through technology-integrated teaching and seek positions in mathematics, physics, or computer science education.
