# ABOUT ME

<p>
I am a computational scientist and scientific machine learning researcher working at the intersection of mathematics, physics, machine learning, biomedical engineering, and cybernetics. My work involves developing mathematical and computational models for detecting and characterising long-range dependence and scale-free dynamics signatures in neural time series data, particularly in EEG time series contaminated with non-stationary drifts and heavy-tailed amplitude bursts, where long-range dependence and heavy-tailed behaviour are present and correlate with neural dynamics and neurological disease progression.

In particular, I am interested in:
<ul>
      <li> Neural fractional stochastic differential equations (fSDE) network models for generating EEG time series data with long-range dependence and heavy-tail amplitude fluctuations, and estimating persistence (memory) in EEG time series.
      <li> Physics-based machine learning estimators for detecting and characterising long-range dependence and heavy-tail distribution signatures in EEG time series with irregular sampling and weak heteroskedasticity.
</ul>
